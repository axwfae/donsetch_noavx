DonSeTch gives any AI agent full web research from a single local process. Three tools, zero API keys, zero accounts. Built in Rust — one binary, no Python, no Playwright, no Selenium, no `reqwest`, no `hyper`. Every layer built from scratch.

Works with every MCP client: Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, anything that speaks MCP. Also works as a standalone CLI.

## ✨ What makes it different

| | What it does |
|---|---|
| 🛡️ **Real Chrome TLS** | Drives Chrome's own BoringSSL natively. Your ClientHello IS Chrome's ClientHello — fingerprint is emergent from the real engine, not a faked table that rots. |
| ⏱️ **Temporal stealth** | TLS session resumption, conditional revalidation (304), persistent cookies, connection pooling. The loudest remaining bot tell — and nobody else fakes it. |
| 👻 **Solve-and-bounce** | Browser solves the challenge, hands cookies to tier 1, goes to sleep. Tier 1 fetches at full speed. The browser almost never fetches content. |
| 🧠 **Self-improving fetch** | Learns from every fetch. Cookie lifetimes learned adaptively. Warm starts skip the browser entirely. Converges to optimal routing per domain. |
| 🔎 **Semantic reranking** | Local ONNX cross-encoder reads query + result through full attention. Pushes out generic articles that keyword-match but aren't about the topic. |
| 🔑 **Keyless search** | 10+ backends in parallel, fused by cross-engine consensus. No API keys, no accounts, no billing. $0 forever. BYOK optional. |
| 📄 **Pixel-fusion PDF** | Glyphs + rendered pixels from the same stream, fused deterministically. No hallucination. Per-region trust audit. Scanned PDFs auto-OCR'd. |
| 🧬 **Built from scratch** | Own HTTP/2 (HPACK, flow control), own extraction engine, own PDF parser, own search aggregator, own crawl engine. Zero dependency on existing OSS web tooling. |
| 🪶 **2,363 tokens** | Three tools, 2,363 tokens total in the MCP context — measured with tiktoken (GPT-4o tokenizer). No bloat, no redundancy, every token earns its place. |

## 📦 Install

### Option 1 — npm (recommended)

```bash
npm install -g donsetch
```

Downloads the prebuilt Linux binary from GitHub Releases with SHA256 verification. No build tools needed. Pick the right one for your CPU — see the AVX warning at the top of this page.

| Platform | Binary |
|---|---|
| Linux x86_64 (AVX) | `donsetch-linux-x64.tar.gz` |
| Linux x86_64 (**no AVX**) | `donsetch-linux-x64-noavx.tar.gz` |
| Termux (Android) | Build from source (see build notes) |

### Option 2 — Pi agent (native extension)

```bash
pi install npm:donsetch
```

Installs DonSeTch as a native pi extension. The donsetch MCP binary spawns at session start, discovers its 3 tools dynamically, and registers them as native pi tools — no MCP adapter, no proxy, no config. Tools stay in sync with the binary automatically (zero maintenance). If the binary is missing, the extension auto-downloads it from GitHub Releases.

Update with `pi update --extensions` — both the binary and extension update together.

### Option 3 — Build from source

| Dependency | Why | Linux |
|---|---|---|
| **Rust** | Build toolchain | `rustup` |
| **Go** | BoringSSL build | `pacman -S go` |
| **NASM** | BoringSSL assembly | `pacman -S nasm` |
| **CMake** | BoringSSL build | `pacman -S cmake` |

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dondai44423/donsetch.git
cd donsetch
cargo build --release
```

Binary lands at `target/release/donsetch`. First build takes ~2 min (compiling BoringSSL). Subsequent builds are cached.

<details>
<summary><b>Build notes</b></summary>

- **BoringSSL** is vendored and built from source via `boring-sys`. First build compiles it (~2 min), then cached.
- **PDFium** is downloaded as a static library by `build.rs` — no manual setup.
- **ONNX Runtime** is downloaded at build time by `oar-ocr` (OCR) and `ort` (reranker) when you enable `--features download-binaries`.
- **Models** (OCR + reranker) download on first use to `~/.cache/donsetch/`, not bundled in the binary.
- **Feature flags**: `default = []` — the core tool (fetch, search, crawl, PDF) works standalone. Build with `--features ocr,rerank,download-binaries` for OCR + semantic reranking (downloads prebuilt ONNX Runtime). The prebuilt npm binary ships with both features enabled. See "Build for CPUs without AVX" below for the `noavx` variant.
- **Chromium** (optional): needed for tier 2 browser escalation on bot-walled sites. Linux: `pacman -S chromium`. **Ubuntu Snap**: set `DONGHOST_CHROME=/snap/chromium/current/usr/lib/chromium-browser/chrome` — the `/snap/bin/chromium` wrapper doesn't reliably pass CDP flags.
- **Linux Xvfb**: for headful Chrome on Linux, `xorg-server-xvfb` is needed. DonSeTch starts Xvfb automatically.
- **Linux ARM64 (aarch64)**: the default build (no features) works out of the box. If you enable `--features ocr,rerank,download-binaries`, ONNX Runtime's C++ global constructors may deadlock at startup on aarch64. Install `lld` for linking LLVM-produced PDFium archives (`apt install lld`).
- **Termux (Android)**: the default build works. Install `pkg install rust clang make pkg-config go` and `cargo build --release`. Chromium: `pkg install x11-repo && pkg install chromium`. DonSeTch auto-detects Termux and uses headless mode (no Xvfb needed). Install `lld` for PDFium linking: `pkg install lld`.

<details>
<summary><b>Build for CPUs without AVX</b></summary>

The prebuilt ONNX Runtime binaries used by `ocr`/`rerank` target **x86-64-v3**
(AVX2+FMA) and crash with `SIGILL` on CPUs without AVX — Intel Bay Trail
Atom/Celeron (N3540, J1900, ...), which only have SSE4.2.

**Fast path (prebuilt)**: every GitHub Release also ships a
`donsetch-linux-x64-noavx.tar.gz` artifact built by CI with AVX disabled.
Download it from the release page and drop the `donsetch` binary into your
`PATH` — no build tools needed.

**Build path**: or build ONNX Runtime from source with AVX disabled and link
it locally:

```bash
# 1) Compile ONNX Runtime without AVX (slow, ~30min-2h; can be done on any
#    modern x86-64 machine and the result copied over).
./scripts/build-onnxruntime-noavx.sh

# 2) Build donsetch against it.
export ORT_LIB_PATH="$PWD/vendor/onnxruntime-noavx/build"
cargo build --release --features ocr,rerank,noavx
```

Notes:

- The core tool (no features, `cargo build --release`) has **no** AVX
  requirement at all — it runs on these CPUs as-is. `noavx` only matters
  if you want OCR / semantic reranking.
- `--features noavx` and `--features download-binaries` are mutually
  exclusive in effect: enable exactly one of them (never both).
- The build script also works when run on a faster machine — the produced
  `libonnxruntime.a` is CPU-agnostic once AVX is disabled.

## 🎯 Two ways to use it

DonSeTch is **one binary, two interfaces**. Same engine, same output, same reliability.

### MCP Server (for AI agents)

Point your AI agent at the binary. No arguments, no API keys, no environment variables.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "donsetch": { "command": "donsetch", "args": ["mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Or use `npx` without global install:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "donsetch": { "command": "npx", "args": ["donsetch", "mcp"] }
  }
}
```

Works with Claude Code, Cursor, OpenCode, Pi, Windsurf, and any client that speaks MCP. Three tools: `web_fetch`, `web_search`, `web_crawl`.

### CLI (for humans and scripts)

```bash
donsetch fetch https://example.com
donsetch search "rust async patterns"
donsetch crawl https://docs.example.com --topic "api reference"
```

Same engine, same output — the CLI is a thin adapter over the same `call_tool` function the MCP server uses. Every feature available to the agent is available on the command line.

```bash
donsetch fetch https://example.com --focus "pricing" --max-chars 2000
donsetch search "GLM 5.2" --intent paper --max-results 5 --json
donsetch crawl https://docs.python.org --mode map --topic "asyncio"
donsetch keys add tinyfish sk-tinyfish-...
donsetch doctor
donsetch update
```

<details>
<summary><b>All CLI commands</b></summary>

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `fetch <url>` | Fetch a URL as clean markdown. Auto bot-wall bypass, PDF, JS render. |
| `search <query>` | Web search — 10+ keyless engines merged + reranked, or your API keys. |
| `crawl <url>` | Crawl a site into markdown. Sitemap-aware, focus-ranked, resumable. |
| `mcp` | Start MCP server (JSON-RPC on stdio). |
| `keys` | Manage BYOK search provider keys (`add`, `remove`, `list`, `default`, `reset`, `export`, `import`, `clear`). |
| `proxy` | Manage proxy configuration (`add`, `remove`, `list`, `check`, `clear`, `test`, `import`, `export`). |
| `status` | Quick status overview — version, keys, proxies, cache, health. |
| `doctor` | Health check with auto-fix. |
| `update` | Self-update from GitHub Releases. |
| `rollback` | Revert to previous version. |
| `version` | Show version and build info. |
| `tools` | Print tool schemas as JSON (same as MCP `tools/list`). |

</details>

---

## 🎯 The 3 tools

| Tool | One-liner |
|------|-----------|
| 🌐 **`web_fetch`** | Fetch any URL as clean markdown. HTTP first, escalates to headless browser if blocked. PDFs with OCR + per-page confidence, `focus` for token savings, `toc`/`section`, pagination, `actions` for in-page browser control (click/type/press/scroll/wait). |
| 🔎 **`web_search`** | Keyless multi-engine web search. 10+ backends in parallel, consensus + semantic reranking, query-aware official-source placement. Returns URLs + snippets, not content. |
| 🕷️ **`web_crawl`** | Best-first same-domain crawl. Sitemap + frontier, elastic pacing, resume tokens. `focus` for budget management. |

---

## 🖱️ Browser actions — page control inside fetch (v2)

`web_fetch` accepts an `actions` array executed in the real headless browser **before** extraction:

```json
{
  "url": "https://duckduckgo.com",
  "actions": [
    { "do": "type", "selector": "input[name=q]", "text": "rust async tokio" },
    { "do": "press", "key": "Enter" },
    { "do": "wait_text", "text": "tokio" }
  ],
  "focus": "tokio"
}
```

Steps: `wait`, `wait_selector`, `wait_text` (deterministic waits — no blind sleeps), `click` (by CSS selector or visible text), `hover`, `type` (human-cadence keystrokes), `press`, `scroll`. Up to 16 steps. After the script runs, the normal extraction pipeline works on the final DOM — `focus`, `section`, `toc` all apply to the interacted-with page. Per-step results come back in `structuredContent.actions`; the first failing step aborts honestly with everything that succeeded, so you fix one step and re-run. Form submits, search flows, load-more buttons, lazy-load scrolls — one call, no separate browser tool.

---

## 🛡️ Chrome TLS, not Chrome-like

Everyone in the impersonation game (curl-impersonate, rquest, wreq) patches a foreign TLS stack to *resemble* Chrome and ships hardcoded fingerprint tables that rot as browsers evolve.

DonSeTch does something different in kind:

> **We drive Chrome's own TLS library (BoringSSL) with its native Chrome behaviors switched on** — GREASE, extension permutation, ECH-GREASE, ALPS, SCT, OCSP, brotli cert-compression. The ClientHello is *generated by the same machinery* that generates Chrome's.

When Chrome's TLS posture shifts, we update a data table, not patch a C library. **The fingerprint isn't a table we fake. It's emergent from the real engine.**

<details>
<summary><b>Verified against live Chromium 150 at tls.peet.ws</b></summary>

| Signal | Match |
|---|---|
| **JA4** | cipher hash identical to Chrome 150 |
| **Akamai h2 fingerprint** | `1:65536;2:0;4:6291456;6:262144\|15663105\|0\|m,a,s,p` — exact match |
| **h2 header order** | sec-ch-ua → sec-ch-ua-mobile → sec-ch-ua-platform → ... — exact match |
| **Extension set** | identical (contents differ only in random GREASE/key material, like real Chrome) |

</details>

### Own HTTP/2 stack (because off-the-shelf leaks)

Off-the-shelf h2 (hyper's `h2` crate) doesn't expose pseudo-header order, exact SETTINGS set, WINDOW_UPDATE values, or HPACK indexing strategy — all fingerprintable (Akamai h2 fingerprint). So we wrote our own:

- Own HPACK (RFC 7541 — all 257 Huffman symbols + 61 static entries verified)
- Own frame engine (SETTINGS, HEADERS, DATA, WINDOW_UPDATE, PING, GOAWAY, RST_STREAM, CONTINUATION)
- Own flow control with WINDOW_UPDATE replenishment
- Own connection pool with TLS 1.3 session resumption

**No `reqwest`. No `hyper`. No `isahc`.** Every byte on the wire is ours.

### Temporal stealth (the tell nobody else fakes)

Everyone fakes the *handshake*. But a bot wall's second look is **temporal**: what does the client do *over time*?

| Mechanism | What it does | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| TLS session resumption | Per-origin session-ticket cache. Resumed handshakes are abbreviated. | Scrapers never resume. Chrome always does. |
| h2 connection pool | Connections kept alive, reused across fetches. | Fresh connection every time = bot signal. |
| Conditional revalidation | Sends `If-None-Match` / `If-Modified-Since` on refetch. `304` → serve cached body. | Scrapers never send conditional headers. Browsers always do. |
| Happy Eyeballs | Races IPv6 vs IPv4 with 250ms stagger. | Chrome does exactly this. Fixes dead-IP 10s timeouts. |
| Persistent cookie jar | Cookies survive across calls like a real browser profile. | A client with no cookie memory is a bot. |

**More stealth AND faster.** The rare quadrant.

---

## 👻 Solve-and-bounce

The entire industry does tier 2 wrong: **use a 600MB browser for everything.** Every fetch pays browser startup, browser RAM, browser CPU. And their stealth is *subtractive*: launch with automation flags, then inject JS patches to hide the damage. Every patch is a detectable lie.

DonSeTch inverts both.

> **The browser almost never fetches content.** It exists to do exactly two things HTTP can't: pass JS challenges and execute JS-rendered pages. Its output is *cookies* (handed to tier 1, which fetches at full speed) or *rendered HTML* (handed to the extraction engine).

| Step | What happens | Speed |
|---|---|---|
| 1. Tier 1 fetch | Fast stealth HTTP (BoringSSL TLS) | ~100-300ms |
| 2. Wall detected | Cloudflare / DataDome / PerimeterX / Akamai | — |
| 3. Ghost solves | Headless browser navigates, waits for challenge to clear, harvests clearance cookies | ~2-6s |
| 4. **Bounce** | Cookies handed to tier 1. Tier 1 re-fetches at full speed. Browser goes to sleep. | ~100-300ms |
| 5. Subsequent fetches | Tier 1 with warm cookies. Browser stays asleep. | ~100-300ms |

### Nothing is patched because nothing is broken

Raw CDP launch without `--enable-automation` means `navigator.webdriver` is *natively* false. No JS injection ever. No Runtime, Console, or Debugger domains. Environmental truthfulness instead of spoofing: real window, real GPU, real locale, consistent story.

<details>
<summary><b>Process lifecycle — the RAM-smart part</b></summary>

The ghost process is **SIGSTOP'd** (frozen, not killed) after 20s of idleness:

| State | RAM | CPU | Wake time |
|---|---|---|---|
| Active | full | real | — |
| Frozen (SIGSTOP) | mapped but cold | 0 | ~50ms (SIGCONT) |
| Reaped (>10 min frozen) | freed | 0 | ~1-2s (relaunch, profile keeps warmth) |

Crash-transparent: thaw finds a dead browser → silent relaunch. The agent never sees the lifecycle.

Persistent profile dir `~/.cache/donsetch/ghost-profile`: aged cookie/history state makes challenges EASIER (real users have history) and `cf_clearance` survives daemon restarts.

</details>

---

## 🧠 Self-improving fetch (experimental)

> **Experimental.** Works reliably for most domains, but edge cases exist (stale profiles, cookie race conditions). Disk persistence can be disabled with `DONSEEK_NO_DISK_STATE=1`.

> Every fetch is both an action AND an observation. The system learns from each outcome and routes the next fetch more efficiently. **The more you use DonSeTch, the less it escalates to tier 2.**

No ML, no prediction models. Pure deterministic observation + state → better routing. The loop converges, it doesn't guess.

| Visit | Route decision | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| Visit 1 (unknown) | `Cold` | Tier 1 → walled → ghost solves → cookies stored |
| Visit 2 (cookies fresh) | `Warm` | Tier 1 with injected cookies → success. Ghost stays asleep. |
| Visit N (cookies expired) | `SkipToSolve` | Skip the doomed tier-1 round-trip, go straight to ghost |
| Visit M (24h since cold check) | `RecheckCold` | Try tier 1 cold — the wall may have been removed |

When warm cookies go stale, the system learns the real lifetime: `observed_lifetime = min(previous, now - last_solved)`. Over multiple cycles, it converges to the real cookie lifetime for each domain.

**Only clearance cookies are persisted** (cf_clearance, datadome, _abck, etc.) — tracking cookies are filtered out to keep the state file compact.

**Disable disk persistence** with `DONSEEK_NO_DISK_STATE=1` — keeps in-memory state for the session but skips writing to `~/.cache/donsetch/ghost-state.json`. On by default.

<img src="assets/owlsearch.png" alt="DonSeTch Search">

</div>

## 🔎 Keyless search

No API key, no account, no third-party service. 10+ keyless backends in parallel on your machine, merged, deduped, ranked.

- **10+ independent backends**: Brave, Bing, DuckDuckGo, Mojeek, Yandex, Startpage + keyless verticals (GitHub, Wikipedia, HN, Semantic Scholar, arXiv, StackExchange, MDN, Google News).
- **Semantic reranking**: local ONNX cross-encoder (`ms-marco-MiniLM-L-6-v2`, 23MB, Apache-2.0) reads query + title + snippet through full transformer attention. 60/40 blend with RRF + BM25 + consensus. ~5ms/pair on CPU.
- **Cross-engine consensus**: a URL returned by several independent indexes gets a consensus boost. Every result carries `score`, `consensus` count, and `engines` list.
- **Entity coverage penalty**: anchor entities (hyphenated compounds like "B-tree") and specifiers (version numbers, years) checked against results. Wrong entity → 0.3× score penalty. Fixes BM25 splitting "B-tree" → "b" + "tree" where "binary tree" matches.
- **Honest reporting**: `weak=true` means low consensus. Per-engine status always visible. Never a fake "no results" that's actually a rate limit.

### BYOK (Bring Your Own Keys) — Pro Search, No Vendor Lock-in

The local engine is powerful, but paid providers give you higher rate limits, premium data sources, and managed infrastructure. DonSeTch makes BYOK a first-class feature, not an afterthought:

- **Multi-provider, multi-key stacking** — add as many keys as you want, even for the same provider. Two Exa keys with 1,500 credits each? You now have 3,000 credits in a single pool. DonSeTch rotates across them automatically — when one hits its rate limit or runs dry, it falls through to the next. No manual switching.
- **Smart fallback** — if a provider exhausts all its keys or errors out, DonSeTch falls back to the local keyless engine. You never get a dead search. Set the order yourself: BYOK-first or local-first.
- **Key rotation** — every key tracks its own rate-limit cooldown and credit-depletion state. A throttled key is skipped until it recovers; a depleted key is retired. All automatic.
- **Portable key store** — export, import, transfer, or wipe your keys. Move between machines in one command.

<div align="center">

<img src="assets/byok-keys.png" alt="DonSeTch keys list with configured providers" width="640">

</div>

```bash
# Add keys — stack as many as you want per provider
donsetch keys add exa sk-exa-...         # 1,500 credits
donsetch keys add exa sk-exa-...         # another 1,500 → 3,000 total
donsetch keys add tavily tvly-...
donsetch keys add serper ...
donsetch keys add tinyfish sk-tinyfish-...

# See what's configured (keys are masked)
donsetch keys list

# Set dispatch order — which engine tries first?
donsetch keys default local       # local keyless first, BYOK fallback
donsetch keys default exa          # BYOK first, local fallback

# Back up, transfer, or reset
donsetch keys export ~/donsetch-keys.json
donsetch keys import ~/donsetch-keys.json
donsetch keys clear
```

Providers: **TinyFish** (free tier), **Tavily**, **Serper.dev**, **Exa**.

<div align="center">

<img src="assets/fetch.png" alt="DonSeTch Fetch">

</div>

## 🌐 Fetch

`fetch` tries plain HTTP first (~100-300ms). If the site serves a bot wall or a JS shell, it auto-escalates to the ghost browser, solves the challenge, bounces cookies back to tier 1, and re-fetches at full speed.

- **DonSift extraction engine**: HTML bytes in, agent-native markdown out. Block model: typed blocks (Heading/Para/List/Table/Code/Quote/Media) with heading breadcrumbs.
- **`focus`** — BM25-relevant blocks only. Cuts context 80%+ on long pages. 12-language BM25: CJK character unigrams + bigrams, stopword lists, light stemming, accent folding.
- **`toc` + `section`** — heading outline first, then target one section. Two cheap calls instead of one expensive one.
- **Pagination** — `next_offset` in the response. Call again with `offset=that value`.
- **Token-war policies** — links stripped by default (~30% savings), link-farm lists dropped, bare-link lines dropped, wiki `[edit]` junk dropped, cross-block duplicate suppression.
- **Content classification**: `Article` / `Listing` / `Forum` / `Docs` / `Table` / `Page`.
- **Quality score** (0.0-1.0): content density, metadata, structure, language, text volume.
- **Agent-trust signals inline** — focus-miss notice, section-miss notice, JS-shell warning, empty-content note — all in the content, not metadata.

## 🕷️ Crawl

`crawl` walks same-domain links in best-first order. Two phases: sitemap discovery (cheap URL inventory in one fetch), then Governor-paced frontier walk with extraction per page.

- **Three modes**: `full` (default) = sitemap map + content. `map` = URL inventory only (very cheap). `content` = skip sitemap, BFS from seed.
- **Focus-ranked frontier**: `focus="query"` ranks pages by BM25 relevance and crawls only matching ones.
- **Adaptive pacing**: the Governor paces per (host, lane). Success → steady. 429/503 → exponential. Error → cooldown. Dwell-time variance proportional to page size breaks metronome fingerprinting.
- **Resume tokens**: stopped crawls return a resume token. Call again with `resume=token` to continue. Valid 30 min, survives restarts.
- **Near-dup detection**: title + first 200 normalized chars → hash. Duplicates skipped.
- **Honest stop reasons**: `FrontierEmpty` (done), `MaxPages`/`CharBudget`/`DepthLimit`/`Deadline` (use resume), `ThrottledOut` (wait and resume).
- **Seed always in scope**: `--include`/`--exclude` apply to discovered links only, not the seed entry point.

## 📄 PDF + OCR

DonSeTch detects PDFs (by Content-Type or `%PDF` magic bytes) and parses them to structured markdown using a custom PDFium FFI. No external PDF library, no Python subprocess.

> **DonSeTch fuses both modalities, deterministically.** PDFium gives us both a document's glyph stream (exact text + positions) AND rendered pixels (exact visual ground truth). Both come from the same content stream, so they're already aligned.

**Pixels tell the truth about structure. Glyphs tell the truth about text. The fusion is exact because both render from one stream. No guessing, no hallucination.**

| Innovation | What it does |
|---|---|
| Pixel-fusion rule extraction | Tables/borders/separators detected on the rendered bitmap via morphological opening. A rule line is a fact, not a hypothesis. |
| Span detection by ink continuity | A cell spans a separator iff the separator has NO ink under the cell's row band. Deterministic colspan/rowspan. |
| Trust audit + per-region arbitration | Glyph stream authoritative UNLESS: zero glyphs + pixels (scan), or region ≥30% PUA/garbage. Corrupt regions get OCR'd from pixels even when neighbors read fine. |
| Orientation canonicalization | Vertical/rotated text = same document rotated. Rotate coordinate frames, run ONE pipeline. |
| Confidence honesty | Verbatim glyphs or OCR with per-line confidence. `[uncertain: ...]` markers below threshold. Neural extractors cannot offer this. |
| Forms as data | AcroForm widgets → name/type/value triples. |

| Tier | What | When |
|---|---|---|
| Tier A (always) | Glyph stream + pixel-fusion layout engine | Every page |
| Tier B (lazy) | OCR for pages/regions with no trustworthy text | Scans, broken ToUnicode |

## 🆚 DonSeTch vs wigolo

Both are local-first web tools for AI agents. Both are keyless and open source. The similarities end there.

| | **DonSeTch** | **wigolo** |
|---|---|---|
| **Install** | `npm install -g donsetch` — done | `npx wigolo init` — downloads ~1.5 GB (ML models + browser), then config wizard |
| **Startup time** | 0.3s | ~13s cold start (ML model + browser + module initialization) |
| **Search latency** | 6.1s avg | 23.5s avg (fetches page content during search for ML reranking) |
| **Search engines** | 5 keyless + intent verticals (GitHub, HN, Scholar, StackExchange, MDN) — 5-8 effective per query | 18 adapters total; 4-5 in default keyless mode (Bing, DDG, Wikipedia, Marginalia, Mojeek) |
| **Bot-wall bypass** | Auto-escalation with Chrome-true TLS (BoringSSL) — bypasses Cloudflare on StackOverflow, Amazon, BBC, Guardian | TLS impersonation + stealth browser mode exist, but in testing: blocked on StackOverflow, timed out on Reddit (120s) |
| **Crawl** | Semantic topic filter, sitemap discovery, per-page quality scoring, resume tokens | URL pattern filtering (regex), sitemap strategy, but no semantic topic ranking, no quality scores, no resume |
| **Token efficiency** | 5.7 KB per search, `focus` cuts fetch tokens 50-80% | 11.4 KB per search, 40% is scoring metadata |
| **Dependencies** | 0 npm packages. Single 36 MB Rust binary | 28 npm packages, Playwright browser, ML models, SQLite cache (~1.5 GB total per wigolo docs) |
| **Setup steps** | 1 (`npm install -g donsetch`) | 1-2 (`npx wigolo init` downloads ~1.5 GB, then optional agent wiring + LLM env vars) |
| **Config** | Zero. Works immediately | Init wizard, env vars for LLM provider, optional hybrid search config |
| **Pi agent** | `pi install npm:donsetch` — native extension, zero config | Not available |
| **Fetch success rate** | 87.5% (14/16 tested sites) | 67% (10/15 tested sites) |
| **Cold-start failure points** | Binary, search engines | ML model, Playwright, SQLite, 28-package dependency tree |

DonSeTch is install and use. wigolo is install, download ~1.5 GB of models and browsers, configure, then wait ~13s on every cold start.

## ⚠️ Gotchas

| Surprise | Why |
|---|---|
| First build takes ~2 min | BoringSSL is compiled from source. Cached after that. |
| Go is a build dependency | BoringSSL's build system is Go-based. You need Go even though DonSeTch is Rust. |
| OCR/rerank not in default build | ONNX Runtime's C++ global constructors can deadlock on aarch64. Build with `--features ocr,rerank,download-binaries` to enable (or `--features ocr,rerank,noavx` with `ORT_LIB_PATH` on CPUs without AVX). The prebuilt npm binary ships with both. |
| Interactive captchas not solved | hCaptcha, reCAPTCHA, Turnstile checkbox = honest dead end. No solving service by design. |
| robots.txt ON by default for crawl | `respect_robots=true` for crawl. `fetch` doesn't check robots. |
| Search rate-limits without a proxy | Keyless search scrapes public engines from your IP. Set `DONSEEK_PROXIES` for heavy use. |
| Not built for mass scraping | DonSeTch is for agentic research, not bulk extraction. |
| Disable disk persistence | `DONSEEK_NO_DISK_STATE=1` skips writing self-improvement data to disk. In-memory state still works for the session. |

---

## 🧱 Honest limits

| What it can NOT do | Why |
|---|---|
| Solve CAPTCHAs | Deliberate. You get a clear error, not a hang. |
| Sites requiring login | Out of scope (page rendering, not authenticated sessions). |
| ML-DSA post-quantum signatures | BoringSSL 5.1.0 lacks them. Will be added when BoringSSL gains it. |
| Search with all engines down | Returns an error with per-engine status. Honest, not fake. |
